# arduino-core
Arduino core library makefile for ARM based devices, e.g. MKW WAN 1310 with the SAMD21G microcontroller

You will need the Arduino core files for your board, you can get these from the Arduino IDE for example, by adding the appropriate ARM board, this will download the files. This project simply provides the makefile to build a library from the Arduino core files that can be used in your own projects.

On MacOS for example, these files will be placed in ~/Library/Arduino15/packages/arduino
