# arduino-core
Arduino core library for ARM based devices, e.g. MKW WAN 1310 with the SAMD21G microcontroller

You will need the Arduino core files for your board, you can get these from the Arduino IDE for example, by adding the appropriate ARM board, this will download the files.

On MacOS for example, these files will be placed in ~/Library/Arduino15/packages/arduino
